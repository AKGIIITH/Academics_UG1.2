This is whatever I have kept on PC, to submit on different Platforms in my academic carrer of First Year Second Semester. 

I havent included Question Paper Yet for Both Semester, Reason Being-
1. Most of Exams were Digital or had to write in Question Paper Only
2. I have very less number of paper to upload

If Some One want You can contact me, and Then Upload them as you wish

Courses were: DSA CSO ITL CL LA ISS

ITL had no assignment, It was in class-tutorial assignments and no pdf for lectures. One can learn through book or resources online are available

Many Assignments might be missing, You can check from numbering and ask for required one
If You really want to make it better, Fork the Repo, add Your Academic Year Resources and Help your Juniors too :)

Futher more any other academic help if required, especially for Linguistics Branch, feel free to contact
